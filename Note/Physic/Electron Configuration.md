# Electron configuration of atom 

>[!REQUIREMENT]
>- [[QM Model Of Atom]]

_Fill the orbital with all electrons available._

>[!IMPORTANT]
>- Each orbit can handle 2 electrons
>- In the shell where there are multiple orientation, we must fill each orbit with one electron. Then, we go back and fill the rest with electrons available.
>- Having half full orbitals is more stable than incomplete orbitals (talking about same orbital, different orientation).

`Example:` Filling electron orbital of Chromium: atomic number = 24
**Incorrect:**
![[drawing incomplete chromium configuration]]
$$1s^2 \; 2s^2 \; 2p^6 \; 3s^2 \; 3p^6 \; 4s^2 \; 3d^4 \; (incorrect)$$ **Correct:**
![[drawing complete chromium configuration]]
$$1s^2 \; 2s^2 \; 2p^6 \; 3s^2 \; 3p^6 \; 4s^1 \; 3d^5 \; (correct)$$ 
`Explain:`
- $3d^4$ is not half and also not complete (unstable).
- $4s^1$ is not half still stable and $3d^5$ is half which is more stable than before.

`Example2:` Electron configuration of Nitrogen. N=7.
$$1s^2 \; 2s^2 \; 2p^3$$
`Example3:` Nickel. Ni=28
$$1s^2 \; 2s^2 \; 2p^6 \; 3s^2 \; 3p^6 \; 3d^8$$
