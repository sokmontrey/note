## Black mirror: “The entire history of you”

**Narrative point of view:** The narrative point of view of Black mirror episode “The entire history of you” is from the third-person perspective. Although, sometimes the narrator puts us in the perspective of some characters, which means that there is also a first-person perspective in the film. This can be seen when Liam replays some of the clip on his grain device.

**Characterization:** Liam is a jealous person, he is always overthinking about something that already happened. He kept going back to his wife about her actions with her ex-boyfriend, Jonas. For example, Liam keep replaying the clip of his wife laughing at Jonas unfunny joke in the act of jealousy.

**Setting:** The story takes place in what looks like a future version of society where people have advanced technologies. This was illustrated by the “Grain” technology in which it is very quite far from reality.  The characters are living a luxurious life. They have a collection of expensive cars, the design of their house is “modern”, their attitude, and their party is different from what a normal person would do.

**Theme:** The author is going with the direction of illustrating the dark side of technologies. Noticeably, the story of the entire series can keep itself going by the use of some kind of technology. For example, in the “The entire history of you” episode, characters were having a great agreement. But then, the use of “Grain” device keep making conflict between characters again and again that keep the story going.

**Other Elements:** The author uses many verbal ironies. Apparently, when Liam invite Jonas to his house after the party, later on revealed that he did not intend to do that. 

**Plot:** One of the biggest turning point in the story is when Liam found out that his wife have sex with her ex-boyfriend eighteen mouths ago. This proof that kid is not his daughter, but Ffion's with Jonas. After that, the question has been answered and the story come to an end.
