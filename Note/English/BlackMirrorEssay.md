# Body Paragraphs

**Opening Phrase (CI1)** 
	First, the effects of “Grain” technology on human mind.

---

**Point#1:** 
	Anyone that uses the “Grain” technology can access any event of their life whenever they want. Having a device like this is a great thing because anybody can store any important information they wanted to without having to use their brain. The brain itself does not have the ability to remember anything for a long time with great detail precision. But good things will come at a cost. People will use their brain less and less. Their life is pretty much depend on the tech in every step that they make. This will eventually let them lose their ability to remember any significant tasks. 

---

**Proof#1:** 
	This can be seen in the episode where Liam attends a party which he forgot the name of the lady who is the host. Liam “replay” one of the clip when they first met. “You've met Lucy, my wife, at the Dublin wedding?” his friend asked in the clip. That is when Liam remember her name. 

---

**Comment#1:**  
	He does not pay much of the attention to everything around him. Until later, when he is in need, he would just use the “replay” feature from his “Grain” device. This go on through the entire story, where the “Grain” device will be used for the same purpose.

---

**Transitional Phrase:** 
	More over, remembering everything in your life, is itself, not always a good thing.

---

**Point#2:** 
	People always have bad moments in their life. Most of the time, they want to forget those unpleasant memories. Having a device where they can access those memories with just a few clicks away is pretty hard to actually get rid of it. 
	
---

**Proof#2:** 
	The story actually did illustrate this idea. At the end, Liam having a hard time forgetting everything that he and his wife have done together. With everything still inside that small device, he keeps going back and check on those moments. Until he decided to take out that device by himself. 

---

**Comment#2:** 
	Without the “Grain” device, Liam can easily forget those unbearable memories, as he can find any sort of distraction to get himself away. But having those little memories store in the back of his head is mentally painful. Removing the device by himself, is another story. They gave him a very bad bruise.

---

**Concluding Sentence:**
	Having the “Grain” device can destroy a person from the inside out.

---

**Opening (Transitional) Phrase CI#2:**
	Not only for the human psychology but also human society as well.

---

**Point #1:** 
	The person who use the “Grain” technology are unable to lie because every line they said, every movement they have done, and every person they have met are being recorded. People can just ask to prove when an excuse has been done. People are force to be honest. Honest is a good thing for society. But, unable to lie entirely, is a bad thing. Sometime, telling a lie to a human being would resolve the problem better than just going straight with the truth.

---

**Proof #1** 
	For example, when Liam's wife, Fi, told him that she dated Jonas for only a few weeks, Fi is lying for a reason. She does not want to have any longer complicated conversation. 

---

**Comment #1** 
	And if Liam does not have the “Grain”, everything would have been resolved, not if he keep check the replay and found out more about Fi's relationship with Jonas. That is when things got complicated. Lying in this situation is not a good option for both Liam and Fi as their child is not the child of Liam and Fi. But still, it is a good choice that can help reduce the pain for everyone. The same things can be applied to society, where absolute honest is not always a good thing.

---

**Transitional Phrase:** 
	Future more, people are forced to be honest.

---

**Point #2:** 
	People can enjoy their old time with their own eyes. This might lead to a society where everyone spending their time outside the reality. A society that do not develop well. People spend their time in their own little world and careless about everything around them. These people will be very similar to a drug addict or an alcoholic. Human civilization will go down, no more inventions, and no one who live for the future.

---

**Proof #2:**
	Noticeably, after Liam found out the truth, he spent his time watching “replay” of him with Fi. His house look unordered, he is drunk, and all that he did is spending in fantasy.

---

**Comment #2:**
	This is an evident that Liam could have spent all day in his dream, unless he took out the machine from his head. 
	
---

**Concluding Sentence:**
	With a collection of a society that use this device in the wrong way, human species would fail to develop.

---

**Concluding Paragraph:**
	In conclusion, technology have a good and bad side. But the “Grain” technology in the series “Black mirror” is a serious discussion as the outcome seem to be unacceptable for the person who use it and the society itself.
