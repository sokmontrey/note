A very standard nomenclature for Organic Compounds. Organic Compound have **Common Name** and **Systematic Name**.

# Rule for Systematic Naming
1. Find longest **Carbon Chain** then give a [[#Root Name Table]]
2. Prioritize [[Functional Group List#^0753a1|Functional Group]] then add [[#Suffix]]
3. Identify [[#Substituents]] and thier position on the Carbon Chain then add numbered [[#Prefix]] to the root name.

## Root Name Table

| Number of Carbon | Root Name |
|---|---|
|1| - meth|
|2| - eth|
|3| - prop|
|4| - but|
|5| - pent|
|6| - hex|
|7| - hept|
|8| - oct|
|9| - non|
|10| - dec|

`Example:`
$\ce{CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3} \;:\;BUTane$

## Suffix 
 - Suffix tell us what kind of organic molecule we're dealing with.
 - Choosing suffix is depend of the highest [[#Functional group priority|priority function group]]
 - Other lower priority functional group will considered to be substituents and use [[#Prefix]].
## Prefix
 - Prefix tell use type of [[#Substituents]] in a compound.
 - We usually have number before [[Functional Group List#^0753a1|Prefix Name]] to indicate the position of the substituent itself.

# Functional Groups
_A Functional Group is a Substituent that describe compound's reaction characteristic_

![[Hydrocarbon]]

---

![[Alkyl halide]]

---

![[Oxygen (single-bonded)]]

>[!NOTE]
> Oxygen with one R group is alcohol
> Oxygen with two R group is ether

---

![[Oxygen (double-bonded)]]

>[!NOTE]
> Double bond Oxygen and Carbon with 
> - One R group is Aldehyde
> - Two R group is Ketone
> - One R group and OH group is carboxylic acid
> - One R group and O group is ester

![[Nitrogen]]

![[Sulfur]]

# Substituents
- A Substituent is a group of atom that replace other atom. Like alkyl replace Hydrogen on a C chain.
- Substituent use `Prefix`.
